            <p>Object-Oriented Programming with Java, Part I ends here. Congratulations for
                making it this far! If you want to continue learning and programming, start our
                second part of the course here: <a href="http://mooc.fi/courses/2013/programming-part-2/">Object-Oriented Programming with Java, Part II</a></p>

            <p>Assuming you have NetBeans and TMC already installed in your computer, in NetBeans just change the current
