++++

Create a program that calculates the sum `1+2+3+â€¦+n` where n is a number entered by the user.

Example outputs:

[source]
----
Until what? <font color="red">3</font>
Sum is 6
----

The calculation above was: `1+2+3 = 6.`

[source]
----
Until what? <font color="red">7</font>
Sum is 28
----

The calculation above was: `1+2+3+4+5+6+7 = 28`.

*Hint:* Create the program using the `while` statement. Use a helper variable
in your program to remember how many times the block has been executed. Use also another
helper variable to store the sum. During each execution add the value of the helper variable that
counts the executions to the variable in which you should collect the sum.
