<div class='exgroup'><h4>Exercise 42: A text-based user interface for the Hangman game</h4>
++++

Your friend has programmed a Hangman game for you, but the game lacks the user inferface. The
Hangman has the following methods:

* `hangman.gameOn()` +
  Shows if the game is on<
* `hangman.printStatus()` +
  Prints the game status. Shows how many guesses have been made and the letters that have not been
  used yet.

* `hangman.printWord()`</em><br> +
  Prints the word the user tries to guess. The letters that have not been guessed yet are hidden as
  question marks, like "v?ri?ble".

* `hangman.printMan()` +
  Prints the Hangman.

* `hangman.guess(String letter)` +
  Guesses the letter that is given as a parameter.

You will get a program body from the exercise robot. It already contains some functionalities:

[source,java]
----

    Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);
    Hangman hangman = new Hangman();

    System.out.println("************");
    System.out.println("* Hangman *");
    System.out.println("************");
    System.out.println("");
    printMenu();
    System.out.println("");

    // ADD YOUR IMPLEMENTATION HERE

    System.out.println("Thank you for playing!");
----

In addition to the program body, you will get the method called `printMenu`:

[source,java]
----

public static void printMenu() {
    System.out.println(" * menu *");
    System.out.println("quit   - quits the game");
    System.out.println("status  - prints the game status");
    System.out.println("a single letter uses the letter as a guess");
    System.out.println("an empty line prints this menu");
}
----

The exercise is to be completed in small steps.

<div class='ex'><details class='ex'><summary>Exercise 42.1: Loops and ending loops</summary>
++++

Create a loop in the program that works as a base for the rest of the user
interface. Ask the user to submit the command inside the loop. If the command is "quit",
break the loop.

Use the command `hangman.gameOn` as the condition for the while structure. The loop should look like:

[source,java]
----

while (hangman.gameOn()) {
    String command = reader.nextLine();
    // ...
}
----
++++
</details></div><!-- end ex 42.1-->
++++

In the next set (week) of exercises, we will find out what this peculiar-looking condition for ending the loop is about.

This far the program should produce the following output:

[source]
----
************
* Hangman *
************

 * menu *
quit   - quits the game
status - prints the game status
a single letter uses the letter as a guess
an empty line prints this menu

Type a command:
<font color="red">do not quit</font>

Type a command:
<font color="red">quit</font>
Thank you for playing!
----

<div class='ex'><details class='ex'><summary>Exercise 42.2: Printing the status</summary>
++++

If the user gives the command "status", print the status using the method
`hangman.printStatus()`.

[source]
----
************
* Hangman *
************

* menu *
quit   - quits the game
status - prints the game status
a single letter uses the letter as a guess
an empty line prints this menu

Type a command:
status
You have not made any guesses yet.
Unused letters: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

Type a command:
quit
Thank you for playing!

</details></div><!-- end ex 42.2-->

<div class='ex'><details class='ex'><summary>Exercise 42.3: Making a guess</summary>
++++

If the user types in a single letter as a command, use it to make a guess. Guessing a letter occurs
in the method `hangman.guess(command)`. The guessing command has its own printing
functionality, which it uses to print more information about the guess.

*Hint:* finding out if the command is a single letter is done as follows:

[source,java]
----

String command = reader.nextLine();

if(command.length() == 1) {  // command has only one letter, so it must be a guess
    hangman.guess(command);
}
----

[source]
----
...
Type a command:
<font color="red">a</font>
The letter a is not in the word.

Type a command:
<font color="red">b</font>
The letter b is not in the word.

Type a command:
<font color="red">c</font>
The letter c was found in the word!

Type a command:
<font color="red">quit</font>
Thank you for playing!

<div class='ex'><details class='ex'><summary>Exercise 42.4: Printing out the menu</summary>
++++

If the user types an empty string of characters, meaning a string that has zero length, you need to
call the method `printMenu`. Note that the method `printMenu` is not in the
Hangman game but in your own program.

*Note:* checking if the string is empty is done as follows:

[source,java]
----

String winnie = "the pooh";
if(winnie.isEmpty()) {
    System.out.println("String was empty");
} else {
    System.out.println("I found something!");
}
----

</details></div><!-- end ex 42.4-->
++++

++++
<div class='ex'><details class='ex'><summary>Exercise 42.5: Printing the man and the word</summary>
++++

If the user has not typed the command `quit`, you should call the Hangman game commands
`hangman.printMan()` and `hangman.printWord()` at the end of the loop.

[source]

...
Type a command:
<font color="red">a</font>
The letter a is not in the word.

Word to be guessed: ????

Type a command:
<font color="red">m</font>
The letter m was found in the word!

Type a command:
