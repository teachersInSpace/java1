++++
Create the method `smartCombine` that works like the previous
`combine` method except that numbers can be on the list only once. This means that the method
adds a new number to the list only if the list does not already contain that number. You might
find the method `contains` from the ArrayList class useful. You can use that method
to check if a number is in the list.
