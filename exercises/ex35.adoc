++++

Create a program that calculates the sum of
2^0^ + 2^1^ + 2^2^ +... + 2^n^, where `n` is a number entered by the user. +
The notation 2^i^ means raising the number 2 to the power of i, for example
2^4^ = 2*2*2*2 = 16. +
In Java we cannot write a^b^ directly, but instead we can
calculate the power with the command `Math.pow(number, power)`. Note that the command
returns a number of `double` type (i.e. floating point number). A double can be
converted into the `int` type (i.e. whole number) as follows:
`int result = (int)Math.pow(2, 3)`. This assigns the value of 2^3^ to variable
result.

Example outputs:

----
Type a number: 3
The result is 15

[source]
----
Type a number: 7
The result is 255
