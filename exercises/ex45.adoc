Create the method `greatest`, which gets three integers as parameters and then returns
the greatest of them. If there are several parameters that are equally great, you can decide which one
is returned. Printing should be done in the main program.

[source,java]
----
public static int greatest(int number1, int number2, int number3) {
    // write your code here
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    int answer =  greatest(2, 7, 3);
    System.out.println("Greatest: " + answer);
}
----

Example output:

Greatest: 7
