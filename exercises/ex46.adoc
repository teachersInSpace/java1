++++

Create the method `average`, which calculates the average of the numbers it gets as
parameters. Inside the method you should use the method `sum` as a helper!

Place the method in the following program body:


[source,java]
----
public static double average(int number1, int number2, int number3, int number4) {
  // write your code here
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
  double answer = average(4, 3, 6, 1);
  System.out.println("average: " + answer);
}

----

Program output:

[source]
----

average: 3.5
----

Make sure you remember how you can transform a whole number (`int`) into a decimal number
  (`double`)!
