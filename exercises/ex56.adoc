++++

Create the method `reverse` that puts the given string in reversed order. Use the
following program body for the method:

[source,java]
----
public static String reverse(String text) {
// write your code here
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.print("Type in your text: ");
String text = reader.nextLine();
System.out.println("In reverse order: " + reverse(text));
}
----

*Hint:* you probably need to build the reversed string character by character in your
method. You can use a String-type variable as a helper during the building process. In the beginning, the
helper variable should have an empty string of characters as a value. After this, new characters
are added to the string one by one.

[source]
----
String help = "";

// ...
// adding a character to the help variable
help = help + character;
----

Program output:
[source]
----
Type a text: <font color="red">example</font>
