++++

Create a program that reads numbers from the user and prints their sum. The program should stop
        asking for numbers when user enters the number 0. The program should be structured like this:

[source,java]
----

Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);
int sum = 0;
while (true) {
    int read = Integer.parseInt(reader.nextLine());
    if (read == 0) {
        break;
    }

    // DO SOMETHING HERE

    System.out.println("Sum now: " + sum);
}

System.out.println("Sum in the end: " + sum);
----
The program should work as follows:

[source]
----
3
Sum now: 3
2
Sum now: 5
1
Sum now: 6
1
Sum now: 7
0
Sum in the end: 7
