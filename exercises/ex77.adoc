++++
The University of Helsinki students use a so-called Lyyra cards to pay for their meals in
student cafeterias. In this assignment, we implement the class `LyyraCard` that simulates
the Lyyra card.

+++h4 class="req">Class skeleton</h4>+++

Start by adding the class `LyyraCard` to your project.

Then implement the `LyyraCard` constructor that gets the starting balance of
the card as parameter. The card saves the balance in the object variable `balance`.
Implement also the `toString` method that returns a string of the form "The
card has X euros".

The skeleton of class `LyyraCard` looks like this:

[source,java]
----
public class LyyraCard {
    private double balance;

    public LyyraCard(double balanceAtStart) {
        // write code here
    }

    public String toString() {
        // write code here
    }
}
----

The following main program can be used to test the program:

[source,java]
----
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LyyraCard card = new LyyraCard(50);
        System.out.println(card);
    }
}
----

The output should be:

[source]
----
The card has 50.0 euros
----

    <h4 class="req">Paying with card</h4>

    Implement the following methods to `LyyraCard`:

[source,java]
----
public void payEconomical() {
    // write code here
}

public void payGourmet() {
    // write code here
}
----

Method `payEconomical` should decrease the balance by 2.50 euros and method
`payGourmet` by 4.00 euros.

The following main program can be used to test the program:

[source,java]
----
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LyyraCard card = new LyyraCard(50);
        System.out.println(card);

        card.payEconomical();
        System.out.println(card);

        card.payGourmet();
        card.payEconomical();
        System.out.println(card);
    }
}
----

The output should be:

[source]
----
The card has 50.0 euros
The card has 47.5 euros
The card has 41.0 euros
----

+++<h4 class="req">Balance nonnegative</h4>+++

Change methods `payEconomical` and `payGourmet` so that if there is
not enought money, the balance does not change.

The following main program can be used to test the program:

[source,java]
----
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LyyraCard card = new LyyraCard(5);
        System.out.println(card);

        card.payGourmet();
        System.out.println(card);

        card.payGourmet();
        System.out.println(card);
    }
}
----

The output should be:

[source]
----
The card has 5.0 euros
The card has 1.0 euros
The card has 1.0 euros
----

Above, the second call `payGourmet` does not alter the balance since there is not
enough money on the card for a gourmet lunch.

+++<h4 class="req">Loading money to card</h4>+++

Add the `LyyraCard` the following method:

[source,java]
----
public void loadMoney(double amount) {
    // write code here
}
----

The method should increase the balance of the card by the given amount. However, the maximum
balance on a card is 150 euros. In case the balance after loading money would be more than
that, it should be truncated to 150 euros.

The following main program can be used to test the program:

[source,java]
----
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LyyraCard card = new LyyraCard(10);
        System.out.println(card);

        card.loadMoney(15);
        System.out.println(card);

        card.loadMoney(10);
        System.out.println(card);

        card.loadMoney(200);
        System.out.println(card);
    }
}
----

The output should be:

[source]
----
The card has 10.0 euros
The card has 25.0 euros
The card has 35.0 euros
The card has 150.0 euros
----

+++<h4 class="req">Loading a negative amount</h4>+++

Change the method `loadMoney` so that the balance of the card does not change if
the amount to load is negative.

The following main program can be used to test the program:

[source,java]
----
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LyyraCard card = new LyyraCard(10);
        System.out.println("Pekka: " + card);
        card.loadMoney(-15);
        System.out.println("Pekka: " + card);
    }
}
----

The output should be:

[source]
----
Pekka: The card has 10.0 euros
Pekka: The card has 10.0 euros
----

+++<h4 class="req">Multiple cards</h4>+++

Write a main method that does the following:

* Creates a LyyraCard for Pekka with initial balance of 20 euros
* Creates a LyyraCard for Brian with initial balance of 30 euros
* Pekka buys gourmet lunch
* Brian buys economical lunch
* cards are printed (both on their own row, starting with the name of the card
  owner)
* Pekka loads 20 euros
* Brian buys gourmet lunch
* cards are printed (both on their own row, starting with the name of the card
 owner)
* Pekka buys economical lunch
* Pekka buys economical lunch
* Brian loads 50 euros
* cards are printed (both on their own row, starting with the name of the card
owner)

The main skeleton is as follows:

[source,java]
----
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LyyraCard cardPekka = new LyyraCard(20);
        LyyraCard cardBrian = new LyyraCard(30);

        // write code here
    }
}
----

The output should be:
[source]
----
Pekka: The card has 16.0 euros
Brian: The card has 27.5 euros
Pekka: The card has 36.0 euros
Brian: The card has 23.5 euros
Pekka: The card has 31.0 euros
Brian: The card has 73.5 euros
