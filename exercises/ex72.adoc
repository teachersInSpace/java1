<div class='exgroup'><h3>Exercise 72: Accounts</h3>
++++

You are handed a ready-made class `Account` along with your exercise files. The object
of the class `Account` represents a bank account that has a balance (meaning some
amount of money). The accounts are used as follows:

[source,java]
----
Account bartosAccount = new Account("Barto's account",100.00);
Account bartosSwissAccount = new Account("Barto's account in Switzerland",1000000.00);

System.out.println("Initial state");
System.out.println(bartosAccount);
System.out.println(bartosSwissAccount);

bartosAccount.withdrawal(20);
System.out.println("Barto's account balance is now: "+bartosAccount.balance());
bartosSwissAccount.deposit(200);
System.out.println("Barto's Swiss account balance is now: "+bartosSwissAccount.balance());

System.out.println("Final state");
System.out.println(bartosAccount);
System.out.println(bartosSwissAccount);

<div class='ex'><details><summary>Exercise 72.3: Money transfers</summary>
++++

*Note:* there is a different exercise template for each of the sub-exercises.
For this exercise use the template 072.3

In the above program, you made a money transfer from one person to another. Let us next
create a method that does the same!

Create the method `public static void transfer(Account from, Account to, double
howMuch)` in the given program body. The method transfers money from one account to
another. You do not need to check that the `from` account has enough balance.

After completing the above, make sure that your `main` method does the following:


. Creates an account `"A"` with the balance of 100.0
. Creates an account `"B"` with the balance of 0.0
. Creates an account `"C"` with the balance of 0.0
. Transfers 50.0 from account A to account B
. Transfers 25.0 from account B to account C
