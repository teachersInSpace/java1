<div class='ex'><details class='ex'><summary>Exercise 91: Extending MyDate</summary>
++++

In this assignment we will extend the class `MyDate`, that was developed in chapter
  24.7. The code of the class:
[source,java]
----
public class MyDate {
    private int day;
    private int month;
    private int year;

    public MyDate(int day, int month, int year) {
        this.day = day;
        this.month = month;
        this.year = year;
    }

    public String toString() {
        return this.day + "." + this.month + "." + this.year;
    }

    public boolean earlier(MyDate compared) {
        // first we'll compare years
        if ( this.year &lt; compared.year ) {
            return true;
        }

        // if the years are the same, we'll compare the months
        if ( this.year == compared.year &amp;&amp; this.month &lt; compared.month ) {
            return true;
        }

        // years and months the same, we'll compare the days
        if ( this.year == compared.year &amp;&amp; this.month == compared.month &amp;&amp;
                this.day &lt; compared.day ) {
            return true;
        }

        return false;
    }
}
----

+++<h4 class="req">Next day</h4>+++

Add to the class MyDate the method `public void advance()` that advances the date by
  one. <strong>Note:</strong> In this assignment we assume that all the months have 30 days!

+++<h4 class="req">Advancing many days</h4>+++

Add also overloaded version `public void advance(int numberOfDays)`. This method
  should advance the day by the number given as parameter. Implement this method so that it calls the
  method `advance()` that was defined in the previous part of the assignment, e.g. the
  call `advance(5)` should call `advance()` 5 times. Again assume that all the
  months have 30 days!

+++<h4 class="req">Creation of a new date</h4>+++

Add to the class `MyDate` the method `MyDate afterNumberOfDays(int days)`,
  that returns a <strong>new</strong> `MyDate`-object that has the date which equals the
  date of the object for which the method was called advance by the parameter of the method
  `days`. Again assume that all the months have 30 days!
Note that the object for which this method is called should not change!
Since the method creates a <b>new object</b>, the skeleton is of the form:
[source,java]
----
public MyDate afterNumberOfDays(int days){
    MyDate newMyDate = new MyDate( ... );

    // some code here

    return newMyDate;
}
----
The following code
[source,java]
----
public static void main(String[] args) {
    MyDate day = new MyDate(25, 2, 2011);
    MyDate newDate = day.afterNumberOfDays(7);
    for (int i = 1; i &lt;= 7; ++i) {
        System.out.println("Friday after  " + i + " weeks is " + newDate);
        newDate = newDate.afterNumberOfDays(7);
    }
    System.out.println("This week's Friday is " + day);
    System.out.println("The date 790 days from this week's Friday is  " + day.afterNumberOfDays(790));
}
----
should print:
----
Friday after  1 weeks is 2.3.2011
Friday after  2 weeks is 9.3.2011
Friday after  3 weeks is 16.3.2011
Friday after  4 weeks is 23.3.2011
Friday after  5 weeks is 30.3.2011
Friday after  6 weeks is 7.4.2011
Friday after  7 weeks is 14.4.2011
This week's Friday is 25.2.2011
The date 790 days from this week's Friday is  5.5.2013
