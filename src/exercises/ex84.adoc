+++<h4>Multiple constructors</h4>+++

Make a class `Counter` that holds a number that can be decreased and increased. The
  counter also has an optional <em>check</em> that prevents the counter from going below 0. The class
  has to have the following constructors:

* `public Counter(int startingValue, boolean check)` creates a new counter with
  the given value. The check is on if the parameter given to `check` was
  `true`.* `public Counter(int startingValue)` creates a new counter with the given value.
  The check on the new counter should be off.* `public Counter(boolean check)` creates a new counter with the starting value 0. The check is on if the parameter given to `check` was `true`.* `public Counter()` creates a new counter with the starting value of 0 and with
  checking off.

and the following methods:

* `public int value()` returns the current value of the counter* `public void increase()` increases the value of the counter by one* `public void decrease()` decreases the value of the counter by one, but not
    below 0 if the check is on


+++<h4>Alternative methods</h4>+++

Create also a one parametered versions of the methods `increase` and
  `decrease`:

* `public void increase(int increaseAmount)` increases the value by the amount of
  the parameter. If the value of the parameter is negative, the value will not change.* `public void decrease(int decreaseAmount)` decreases the value of the counter by
  the amount given by the parameter, but not below 0 if the check is on. If the value of the
  parameter is negative, the value of the counter will not change.
