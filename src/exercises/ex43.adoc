++++

Create the method `sum` that calculates the sum of numbers the method receives as
parameters.

Place the method in the following program body:

[source,java]
----
public static int sum(int number1, int number2, int number3, int number4) {
    // write program code here
    // remember that the method needs a return in the end
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    int answer = sum(4, 3, 6, 1);
    System.out.println("sum: " + answer);
}
----

    Example output:
[source]
----
sum: 14
----

*Note:* if an exercise involves a method *returning* something, it
means that the return type needs to be defined for the method, and that the method needs to
return a value of that type using the `return` command. In this case, the method does not print (or use the
command `System.out.println(..)`), the method caller handles printing, here, the main program.
