++++

Let us implement a program that prints the Night sky. The sky has a star density. If the density
is e.g. `0.1`, roughly 10% of the sky is covered with stars.

Stars print out as `*`-characters. Below an example that demonstrates how the
`NightSky` could be used when all the steps of the assignment are done.

[source,java]
----
NightSky NightSky = new NightSky(0.1, 40, 10);
NightSky.print();
System.out.println("Number of stars: " + NightSky.starsInLastPrint());
System.out.println("");

NightSky = new NightSky(0.2, 15, 6);
NightSky.print();
System.out.println("Number of stars: " + NightSky.starsInLastPrint());

                                     *
        *       *      *         *  *

                            *  *

     *                             *

*Note!* in the assignment use the `for`-clause. Despite that the
previous chapter described nested loops, in this assignment we "hide" the nested loop
within a method.

+++<h4>Class NightSky and a star line</h4>+++

Create the class `NightSky`, that has three object variables: density
(`double`), width (`int`), and height (`int`). The class should
have 3 constructors:

* `public NightSky(double density)` creates a NightSky object with the given star
density. Width gets the value `20` and height the value `10`.
* `public NightSky(int width, int height)` creates a NightSky object with the
given width and height. Density gets the value `0.1`.
* `public NightSky(double density, int width, int height)` creates a
NightSky-object with the given density, width and height

Add to the class `NightSky` the method `printLine`, that prints one line of
stars. The line length is determined by the value of the field `width` and
the field `density` determines the star probability. For each printed
character you should use a `Random` object to decide if it prints out as a white space
or a star. The method `nextDouble` will probably be of use now.

In the following example:

[source,java]
----
NightSky NightSky = new NightSky(0.1, 40, 10);
NightSky.printLine();
----


----
        *  *                  *
----

+++<h4>Printing the night sky</h4>+++

Add the class `NightSky` the method `print`, that prints the night sky of
the given size. Use the method `printLine` to print each separate line of the night sky.
An example in the following:

[source,java]
----
NightSky NightSky = new NightSky(8, 4);
NightSky.print();
----


----
    *

  *
    *
----


+++<h4>Counting the number of stars</h4>+++

Add the class `NightSky` an field starsInLastPrint (`int`) and
the method `starsInLastPrint()`, that returns the number of stars printed in the
previous night sky. Example in the below:

[source,java]
----
NightSky NightSky = new NightSky(8, 4);
NightSky.print();
System.out.println("Number of stars: " + NightSky.starsInLastPrint());
System.out.println("");

NightSky.print();
System.out.println("Number of stars: " + NightSky.starsInLastPrint());
----


----

 *

Number of stars: 1

 *
      *
*

Number of stars: 3
