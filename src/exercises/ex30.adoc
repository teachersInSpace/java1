++++

Create a program that prints all whole numbers from 1 to the number the user enters.

Up to what number? <font color="red">3</font>
1
2
3
----

[source]
----
Up to what number? <font color="red">5</font>
1
2
3
4
5
----

*Tip:* The number you read from the user now works as the upper limit in the condition of
        the `while` statement. Remember that in Java `a &lt;= b` means
        _a is less than or equal to b_.
