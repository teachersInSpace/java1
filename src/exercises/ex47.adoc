<div class='ex'><details class='ex'><summary>Exercise 47: The length of a name</summary>
++++


Create a program that asks for the user's name and says how many characters the name
contains.

[source]
----
Type your name: <font color="red">Paul</font>
Number of characters: 4
----

[source]
----
Type your name: <font color="red">Catherine</font>
Number of characters: 9
----

*Note!* Your program should be structured so that you put the calculating of the
name length in it's own method: `public static int calculateCharacters(String text)`.
The tests will be testing both the method `calculateCharacters` and the
program overall.
