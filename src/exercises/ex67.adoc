++++

Create the method `variance`, which receives a list of integers as a parameter and then returns
the sample variance of that list. You can check how a sample variance is calculated in
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance#Population_variance_and_sample_variance[Wikipedia], under
"Population variance and sample variance".

*Note:* the method should use the method `average` of exercise 64 to calculate the
average of the parameters. The method should be called only once!

[source,java]
----
public static double variance(ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; list) {
  // write your code here
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
  ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();
  list.add(3);
  list.add(2);
  list.add(7);
  list.add(2);

  System.out.println("The variance is: " + variance(list));
}
----

Program output:

[source]
----
The variance is: 5.666667
----

(The average of the numbers is 3.5, so the sample variance is ((3 - 3.5)² + (2 - 3.5)² + (7 - 3.5)²
+ (2 - 3.5)²)/(4 - 1) ? 5,666667.)

*Note while testing your program!* Sample variance for a list that
contains only one item is not defined! It causes a division by zero in the formula. Java considers
the result of division by zero as a *Not a Number* (`NaN`).
