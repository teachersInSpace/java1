++++

In this assignment, we use the already given class `Person` and are supposed to build
  a new class `Reformatory`. Reformatory objects do certain things to persons, e.g.
  measure their weight and feed them.
Note: you should not alter the code in the class Person!

+++<h4>Weight of a person</h4>+++

The reformatory class already has a method skeleton `public int weight(Person
    person)`:
[source,java]
----
public class Reformatory {

    public int weight(Person person) {
       // returns the weight of the parameter
       return -1;
    }
}
----
The method gets a person object as a parameter. The method is supposed to return the weight of
  the parameter, so the method should call a suitable method of `person`, get the return
  value and then return it to the caller.
In the following a reformatory weight's two persons:
[source,java]
----
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Reformatory eastHelsinkiReformatory = new Reformatory();

    Person brian = new Person("Brian", 1, 110, 7);
    Person pekka = new Person("Pekka", 33, 176, 85);

    System.out.println(brian.getName() + " weight: " + eastHelsinkiReformatory.weight(brian) + " kilos");
    System.out.println(pekka.getName() + " weight: " + eastHelsinkiReformatory.weight(pekka) + " kilos");
}
----
The output should be:
----
Brian weight: 7 kilos
Pekka weight: 85 kilos
----

+++<h4>Feeding a person</h4>+++

In the previous part of the assignment, the method `weight` queried some information
  from the parameter object by calling its method. It is also possible to change the state of the
  parameter. Add to class Reformatory the method `public void feed(Person person)` that
  increases the weight of its parameter by one.
Next, an example where first the weight of Pekka and Brian is measured and printed. Then
  Reformatory feeds Brian three times and after that the weights are measured and printed again.
[source,java]
----
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Reformatory eastHelsinkiReformatory = new Reformatory();

    Person brian = new Person("Brian", 1, 110, 7);
    Person pekka = new Person("Pekka", 33, 176, 85);

    System.out.println(brian.getName() + " weight: " + eastHelsinkiReformatory.weight(brian) + " kilos");
    System.out.println(pekka.getName() + " weight: " + eastHelsinkiReformatory.weight(pekka) + " kilos");

    eastHelsinkiReformatory.feed(brian);
    eastHelsinkiReformatory.feed(brian);
    eastHelsinkiReformatory.feed(brian);

    System.out.println("");

    System.out.println(brian.getName() + " weight: " + eastHelsinkiReformatory.weight(brian) + " kilos");
    System.out.println(pekka.getName() + " weight: " + eastHelsinkiReformatory.weight(pekka) + " kilos");
}
----
The output should reveal that Brian has gained 3 kilos:
----
Brian weight: 7 kilos
Pekka weight: 85 kilos

Brian weight: 10 kilos
Pekka weight: 85 kilos
----

+++<h4>Number of times a weight has been measured</h4>+++
Add to class Reformatory the method `public int totalWeightsMeasured()` that returns
  the total number of times a weight has been measured.
With the following main program:
[source,java]
----
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Reformatory eastHelsinkiReformatory = new Reformatory();

    Person brian = new Person("Brian", 1, 110, 7);
    Person pekka = new Person("Pekka", 33, 176, 85);

    System.out.println("total weights measured "+eastHelsinkiReformatory.totalWeightsMeasured());

    eastHelsinkiReformatory.weight(brian);
    eastHelsinkiReformatory.weight(pekka);

    System.out.println("total weights measured "+eastHelsinkiReformatory.totalWeightsMeasured());

    eastHelsinkiReformatory.weight(brian);
    eastHelsinkiReformatory.weight(brian);
    eastHelsinkiReformatory.weight(brian);
    eastHelsinkiReformatory.weight(brian);

    System.out.println("total weights measured "+eastHelsinkiReformatory.totalWeightsMeasured());
}
----
the output should be:
----
total weights measured 0
total weights measured 2
total weights measured 6
