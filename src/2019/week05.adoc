== More about objects and classes

=== Multiple constructors
Let us return to the class that handles Persons again. The class `Person` currently looks
like this:

[source,java]
----
public class Person {

    private String name;
    private int age;
    private int height;
    private int weight;

     public Person(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = 0;
        this.weight = 0;
        this.height = 0;
    }

    public void printPerson() {
        System.out.println(this.name + " I am " + this.age + " years old");
    }

    public void becomeOlder() {
        this.age++;
    }

    public boolean adult(){
        if ( this.age &lt; 18 ) {
            return false;
        }

        return true;
    }

    public double weightIndex(){
        double heightInMeters = this.height/100.0;

        return this.weight / (heightInMeters*heightInMeters);
    }

    public String toString(){
        return this.name + " I am " + this.age + " years old, my weight index is " + this.weightindex();
    }

    public void setHeight(int height){
        this.height = height;
    }

    public int getHeight(){
        return this.height;
    }

    public int getWeight() {
        return this.weight;
    }

    public void setWeight(int weight) {
        this.weight = weight;
    }

    public String getName(){====
        return this.name;
    }
}
----

All person objects are 0 years old at creation, since the constructor sets it to 0:

[source,java]
----
public Person(String name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = 0;
    this.weight = 0;
    this.height = 0;
}
----
We also want to create a person so that in addition to name, can be given an age as a parameter. This can
be achieved easily, since multiple constructors can exist. Let us make an alternative constructor. You
do not need to remove the old one.
[source,java]
----
public Person(String name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = 0;
    this.weight = 0;
    this.height = 0;
}

public Person(String name, int age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.weight = 0;
    this.height = 0;
}
----

Now, creating objects can be done in two different ways:
[source,java]
----
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Person pekka = new Person("Pekka", 24);
    Person esko = new Person("Esko");

    System.out.println( pekka );
    System.out.println( esko );
}
----
----
Pekka, age 24 years
Esko, age 0 years
----

The technique in which a class has two constructors is called <em>constructor overloading</em>. A class
can have multiple constructors, which are different from one another according to parameter quantities and/or
types. However, it is not possible to create two different constructors that have exactly the same type of
parameters. We cannot add a constructor `public Person(String name, int weight)` on top of
the old ones, since it is impossible for Java to tell the difference between this one and the one in which
the integer stands for the age.

=== Calling your own constructor
But wait, in chapter 21 we noted that "copy-paste" code is not too great of an idea! When
            we inspect the overloaded constructors above, we notice that they have the same code repeated in them.
            We are not ok with this.
The old constructor actually is a special case of the new constructor. What if the old
            constructor could 'call' the new constructor? This can be done, since you can call another
            constructor from within a constructor with `this`!
Let us change the old constructor that does nothing, but only calls the new constructor below
            it and asks it to set the age to 0:
[source,java]
----
public Person(String name) {
    this(name, 0);  // run here the other constructor's code and set the age parameter to 0
}

public Person(String name, int age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.weight = 0;
    this.height = 0;
}
----
Calling the own constructor of a class `this(name, 0);` might seem a little peculiar. But we
            can imagine that during the call it will automatically copy-paste the code from the constructor below and
            that 0 is entered to the age parameter.
=== Overloading a method
Just like constructors, methods can also be overloaded and multiple versions of a method can exist. Again,
the parameter types of different versions have to be different. Let us create another version of the
`becomeOlder`, which enables aging the person the amount of years that is entered as a
parameter:

[source,java]
----
public void becomeOlder() {
    this.age = this.age + 1;
}

public void becomeOlder(int years) {
    this.age = this.age + years;
}
----
In the following, "Pekka" is born as a 24-year old, ages one year, and then 10:
[source,java]
----
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Person pekka = new Person("Pekka", 24);

    System.out.println(pekka);
    pekka.becomeOlder();
    System.out.println(pekka);
    pekka.becomeOlder(10);
    System.out.println(pekka);
}
----
Prints:

[source]
----
Pekka, age 24 years
Pekka, age 25 years
Pekka, age 35 years
----
Now, a person has two `becomeOlder` methods. The method that is chosen to be run depends on
the amount of parameters entered in to the method call. The method `becomeOlder` can also be run
through the method `becomeOlder(int years)`:
[source,java]
----
    public void becomeOlder() {
        this.becomeOlder(1);
    }
    public void becomeOlder(int years) {
        this.age = this.age + years;
    }
----

=== Object is at the end of a wire
In chapter 20, we noted that `ArrayList` is at the end of a wire. Also objects are 'at the
end of a wire'. What does this mean? Let us inspect the following example:

[source,java]
----
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Person pekka = new Person("Pekka", 24);

    System.out.println( pekka );
}
----
When we run the sentence `Person pekka = new Person("Pekka", 24);` an object is
born. The object can be accessed through the variable `pekka`. Technically speaking, the object
is not within the variable `pekka` (in the box 'pekka'), but `pekka` refers
to the object that was born. In other words, the object is 'at the end of a wire' that is attached
to a variable named `pekka`. The concept could be visualized like this:
image::../images/lanka1.png[]
Let us add to the program a variable `person` of the type `Person` and set its
starting value to `pekka`. What happens now?
[source,java]
----
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Person pekka = new Person("Pekka", 24);

    System.out.println( pekka );

    Person person = pekka;
    person.becomeOlder(25);

    System.out.println( pekka );
}
----
Prints:
----
Pekka, age 24 years
Pekka, age 49 years
----
In the beginning, Pekka was 24 years old. Then a Person object at the end of a wire attached to a
`Person` variable is aged by 25 years and as a consequence of that Pekka becomes older!
What is going on here?
The command `Person person = pekka;` makes `person` refer to
the same object that `pekka` refers to. So, a copy of the object is not born, but instead both
of the variables refer to the same object. With the command `Person person = pekka;` a <em>copy
of the wire</em> is born. The same thing as a picture (Note: in the picture p refers to the variable pekka, and h to the
variable person in the main program. The variable names have also been abbreviated in some of the following
pictures.):
image::../images/lanka2.png[]
// <img src="https://raw.github.com/UniversityHelsinkiTKTL/MOOC-material/master/img/lanka2.PNG">
In the example, "an unknown `person` steals Pekka's identity". In the following,
we have expanded the example so that a new object is created and `pekka` begins to refer to a
new object:
[source,java]
----
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Person pekka = new Person("Pekka", 24);

    System.out.println( pekka );

    Person person = pekka;
    person.becomeOlder(25);

    System.out.println( pekka );

    pekka = new Person("Pekka Mikkola", 24);
    System.out.println( pekka );
}
----
Prints:
----
Pekka, age 24 years
Pekka, age 49 years
Pekka Mikkola, age 24 years
----
The variable `pekka` refers to one object, but then begins to refer to another. Here is
the situation after running the previous line of code:

image::../images/lanka3.png[]
//<img src="https://raw.github.com/UniversityHelsinkiTKTL/MOOC-material/master/img/lanka3.PNG">
Let's develop the example further by making `person` to refer to 'nothing', to
`null`:
[source,java]
----
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Person pekka = new Person("Pekka", 24);

    System.out.println( pekka );

    Person person = pekka;
    person.becomeOlder(25);

    System.out.println( pekka );

    pekka = new Person("Pekka Mikkola", 24);
    System.out.println( pekka );

    person = null;
    System.out.println( person );
}
----
After running that, the situation looks like this:
<img src="https://raw.github.com/UniversityHelsinkiTKTL/MOOC-material/master/img/lanka4.PNG">
Nothing refers to the second object. The object has become 'garbage'. Java's garbace
            collector cleans up the garbage every now and then by itself. If this did not happen, the garbage would
            pile up in the computer's memory until the execution of the program is done.
We notice this on the last line whine we try to print 'nothing' (`null`) on the last
            line:
----
Pekka, age 24 years
Pekka, age 49 years
Pekka Mikkola, age 24 years
null
----
What happens if we try to call a "nothing's" method, for example the method
            `weightIndex`:
[source,java]
----
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Person pekka = new Person("Pekka", 24);

    System.out.println( pekka );

    Person person = null;
    System.out.println( person.weightIndex() );
}
----
Result:
[source,]
----
Pekka, age 24 years
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException at Main.main(Main.java:20)
Java Result: 1
----
Not good. This might be the first time in your life that you see the text *NullPointerException*.
But we can assure you that it will not be the last. NullPointerException is an exception state, when we
try to call methods of an object with the value `null`.

=== An object as a method parameter
We have seen that a method can have, for example `int, double, String` or ArrayList as its
parameter. ArrayLists and character strings are objects, so as one might guess a method can take any type
of object as a parameter. Let us demonstrate this with an example.
People whose weight index exceeds a certain limit are accepted into the Weight Watchers. The limit is
not the same in all Weight Watchers associations. Let us make a class corresponding to the Weight
Watchers association. As the object is being created, the lowest acceptance limit is passed to the
constructor as a parameter.
[source,java]
----
public class WeightWatchersAssociation {
    private double lowestWeightIndex;

    public WeightWatchersAssociation(double indexLimit) {
        this.lowestWeightIndex = indexLimit;
    }

}
----
Next we will create a method, with which we can check if a person is eligible to the association, in
other words we check if a person's weight index is large enough. The method returns `true`
if the person that is passed in as a parameter is eligible and `false` if not.
[source,java]
----
public class WeightWatchersAssociation {
    // ...

    public boolean isAcceptedAsMember(Person person) {
        if ( person.weightIndex() &lt; this.lowestWeightIndex ) {
            return false;
        }

        return true;
    }
}
----
The method `isAcceptedAsMember` of the WeightWatchersAssociation object gets a
`Person` object as its parameter (or more accurately the wire to the person), and then calls the
method `weightIndex` of the person that it received as a parameter.
In the following, is a test main program in which a person object `matti` and a person
object `juhana` is passed to the weight watchers association's method:
[source,java]
----
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Person matti = new Person("Matti");
    matti.setWeight(86);
    matti.setHeight(180);

    Person juhana = new Person("Juhana");
    juhana.setWeight(64);
    juhana.setHeight(172);

    WeightWatchersAssociation kumpulasWeight = new WeightWatchersAssociation(25);

    if ( kumpulasWeight.isAcceptedAsMember(matti) ) {
        System.out.println( matti.getName() + " is accepted as a member");
    } else {
        System.out.println( matti.getName() + " is not accepted as a member");
    }

    if ( kumpulasWeight.isAcceptedAsMember(juhana) ) {
        System.out.println( juhana.getName() + " is accepted as a memberksi");
    } else {
        System.out.println( juhana.getName() + " is not accepted as a member");
    }
}
----
The program prints:
----
Matti is accepted as a member
Juhana is not accepted as a member
----

[TIP]
====
*A few NetBeans-tips*

* All NetBeans-tips are found http://mooc.fi/courses/general/programming/#netbeans-tips[here]

* *The automatic generating of constructors, getters and setters.*
Go inside of the code block of the class, but outside of all methods and simultaneously
  press Ctrl+Space. If your class, for example, has an object variable `balance`,
  NetBeans will offer you the opportunity to generate the getter and setter methods, and a
  constructor that sets a starting value for the object variable.

=== Another object of the same type as a parameter to a method
We will keep on working with the `Person` class. As we recall, persons know their
            age:
[source,java]
----
public class Person {

    private String name;
    private int age;
    private int height;
    private int weight;

    // ...
}
----
We want to compare ages of two persons. The comparison can be done in a number of ways. We could
define a getter method `getAge` for a person. Comparing two persons in that case would be done
like this:
[source,java]
----
Person pekka = new Person("Pekka");
Person juhana = new Person("Juhana");

if ( pekka.getAge() &gt; juhana.getAge() ) {
    System.out.println(pekka.getName() + " is older than " + juhana.getName());
}
----

We will learn a slightly more object-oriented way to compare the ages of two people.
We will create a method `boolean olderThan(Person compared)` for the Person class, with
            which we can compare a certain person with a person that is given as a parameter.
The method is meant to be used in the following way:
[source,java]
----
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Person pekka = new Person("Pekka", 24);
    Person antti = new Person("Antti", 22);

    if (pekka.olderThan(antti)) {  //  same as pekka.olderThan(antti)==true
        System.out.println(pekka.getName() + " is older than " + antti.getName());
    } else {
        System.out.println(pekka.getName() + " isn't older than " + antti.getName());
    }
}
----
Here, we ask Pekka if he is older than Antti, Pekka replies true if he is, and false if he is not. In
            practice, we call the method `olderThan` of the object that `pekka` refers to. For this method,
      we give as a parameter the object that `antti` refers to.
The program prints:
----
Pekka is older than Antti
----
The program gets a person object as its parameter (or more accurately a reference to a person object,
            which is at 'the end of a wire') and then compares its own age `this.age` to the age of
            the compared `compared.age`. The implementation looks like this:
[source,java]
----
public class Person {
    // ...

    public boolean olderThan(Person compared) {
        if ( this.age &gt; compared.age ) {
            return true;
        }

        return false;
    }
}
----
Even though `age` is a `private` object variable, we can read the value of the
            variable by writing `compared.age`. This is because `private` variables can be read in
            all methods that the class in question contains. Note that the syntax resembles the call of a method of
            an object. Unlike calling a method, we refer to a field of an object, in which case we do not write
            the parentheses.

=== The date as an object
Another example of the same theme. Let us create a class, which can represent dates.
Within an object, the date is represented with three object variables. Let us also make a method,
which can compare whether the date is earlier than a date that is given as a parameter:
[source,java]
----
public class MyDate {
    private int day;
    private int month;
    private int year;

    public MyDate(int day, int month, int year) {
        this.day = day;
        this.month = month;
        this.year = year;
    }

    public String toString() {
        return this.day + "." + this.month + "." + this.year;
    }

    public boolean earlier(MyDate compared) {
        // first we'll compare years
        if ( this.year &lt; compared.year ) {
            return true;
        }

        // if the years are the same, we'll compare the months
        if ( this.year == compared.year &amp;&amp; this.month &lt; compared.month ) {
            return true;
        }

        // years and months the same, we'll compare the days
        if ( this.year == compared.year &amp;&amp; this.month == compared.month &amp;&amp;
                this.day &lt; compared.day ) {
            return true;
        }

        return false;
    }
}
----
Example of usage:
[source,java]
----
public static void main(String[] args) {
    MyDate p1 = new MyDate(14, 2, 2011);
    MyDate p2 = new MyDate(21, 2, 2011);
    MyDate p3 = new MyDate(1, 3, 2011);
    MyDate p4 = new MyDate(31, 12, 2010);

    System.out.println( p1 + " earlier than " + p2 + ": " + p1.earlier(p2));
    System.out.println( p2 + " earlier than " + p1 + ": " + p2.earlier(p1));

    System.out.println( p2 + " earlier than " + p3 + ": " + p2.earlier(p3));
    System.out.println( p3 + " earlier than " + p2 + ": " + p3.earlier(p2));

    System.out.println( p4 + " earlier than " + p1 + ": " + p4.earlier(p1));
    System.out.println( p1 + " earlier than " + p4 + ": " + p1.earlier(p4));
}
----

----
14.2.2011 earlier than 21.2.2011: true
21.2.2011 earlier than 14.2.2011: false
21.2.2011 earlier than 1.3.2011: true
1.3.2011 earlier than 21.2.2011: false
31.12.2010 earlier than 14.2.2011: true
14.2.2011 earlier than 31.12.2010: false

=== Objects on a list
We've used `ArrayList` s in a lot of examples and assignments already. You can add
character strings, for example, to an ArrayList object and going through the strings, searching, removing
and sorting them and so forth, are painless actions.
You can put any type of objects in ArrayLists. Let's create a person list, an
`ArrayList<Person>` and put a few person objects in it:
[source,java]
----
public static void main(String[] args) {
    ArrayList&lt;Person&gt; teachers = new ArrayList&lt;Person&gt;();

    // first we can take a person into a variable
    Person teacher = new Person("Juhana");
    // and then add it to the list
    teachers.add(teacher);

    // or we can create the object as we add it:
    teachers.add( new Person("Matti") );
    teachers.add( new Person("Martin") );

    System.out.println("teachers as newborns: ");
    for ( Person prs : teachers ) {
        System.out.println( prs );
    }

    for ( Person prs : teachers ) {
        prs.becomeOlder( 30 );
    }

    System.out.println("in 30 years: ");
    for ( Person prs : teachers ) {
        System.out.println( prs );
    }
}
----
The program prints:
----
teachers as newborns:
Juhana, age 0 years
Matti, age 0 years
Martin, age 0 years
in 30 years:
Juhana, age 30 years
Matti, age 30 years
Martin, age 30 years
----

=== An object within an object
Objects can have objects within them, not only character strings but also self-defined objects.
            Let's get back to the `Person`-class again and add a birthday for the person. We can use the
            `MyDate`-object we created earlier here:
[source,java]
----
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    private int weight;
    private int height;
    private MyDate birthMyDate;

    // ...
}
----

Let's create a new constructor for persons, which enables setting a birthday:

[source,java]
----
    public Person(String name, int day, int month, int year) {
        this.name = name;
        this.weight = 0;
        this.height = 0;
        this.birthMyDate = new MyDate(day, month, year);
    }
----
So because the parts of the date are given as constructor parameters (day, month, year), the date object
            is created out of them and then <i>inserted</i> to the object variable `birthMyDate`.
Let's edit `toString` so that instead of age, it displays the birthdate:
[source,java]
----
public String toString() {
    return this.name + ", born " + this.birthMyDate;
}
----

And then let's test how the renewed Person class works:
[source,java]
----
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Person martin = new Person("Martin", 24, 4, 1983);

    Person juhana = new Person("Juhana", 17, 9, 1985);

    System.out.println( martin );
    System.out.println( juhana );
}
----
Prints:
----
Martin, born 24.4.1983
Juhana, born 17.9.1985
----
In chapter 24.4, we noted that objects are 'at the end of a wire'. Take a look at that chapter
again for good measure.
Person objects have the object variables `name`, which is a String-object and
`birthMyDate`, which is a MyDate object. The variables of person are consequently both objects,
so technically speaking they don't actually exist within a person object, but are 'at the end of a
wire'. In other words a person has a reference to the objects stored in its object variables. The
concept as a picture:
//<img src="https://raw.github.com/UniversityHelsinkiTKTL/MOOC-material/master/img/person.PNG">

image::../images/person.png[]

The main program now has two person programs at the ends of wires. The persons have a name and a
birthdate. Because both are objects, both are at the ends of wires the person holds.
Birthday seems like a good expansion to the Person class. We notice, however, that the object variable
`age` is becoming obsolete and should probably be removed since the age can be determined easily
with the help of the current date and birthday. In Java, the current day can be figured out, for example,
like this:
[source,java]

int day = Calendar.getInstance().get(Calendar.DATE);

When age is removed, the `olderThan` method has to be changed so that it compares birthdates.
We'll do this as an excersise assignment.

=== A list of objects within an object
Let's expand the `WeightWatchersAssociation` object so that the association records all
            its members into an `ArrayList` object. So in this case the list will be filled with
            `Person` objects. In the extended version the association is given a name as a constructor
            parameter:
[source,java]
----
public class WeightWatchersAssociation {
    private double lowestWeightIndex;
    private String name;
    private ArrayList&lt;Person&gt; members;

    public WeightWatchersAssociation(String name, double lowestWeightIndex) {
        this.lowestWeightIndex = lowestWeightIndex;
        this.name = name;
        this.members = new ArrayList&lt;Person&gt;();
    }

    //..
}
----
Let's create a method with which a person is added to the association. The method won't add
            anyone to the association but people with a high enough weight index. Let's also make a toString with
            which the members' names are printed:
[source,java]
----
public class WeightWatchersAssociation {
    // ...

    public boolean isAccepted(Person person) {
        if ( person.weightIndex() &lt; this.lowestWeightIndex ) {
            return false;
        }

        return true;
    }

    public void addAsMember(Person person) {
        if ( !isAccepted(person) ) { // same as isAccepted(person) == false
            return;
        }

        this.members.add(person);
    }

    public String toString() {
        String membersAsString = "";

        for ( Person member : this.members ) {
            membersAsString += "  " + member.getName() + "\n";
        }

        return "Weightwatchers association " + this.name + " members: \n" + membersAsString;
    }
}
----
The method `addAsMember` uses the method `isAccepted` that was creater
            earlier.
Let's try out the expanded weightwatchers association:
[source,java]
----
public static void main(String[] args) {
    WeightWatchersAssociation weightWatcher = new WeightWatchersAssociation("Kumpulan paino", 25);

    Person matti = new Person("Matti");
    matti.setWeight(86);
    matti.setHeight(180);
    weightWatcher.addAsMember(matti);

    Person juhana = new Person("Juhana");
    juhana.setWeight(64);
    juhana.setHeight(172);
    weightWatcher.addAsMember(juhana);

    Person harri = new Person("Harri");
    harri.setWeight(104);
    harri.setHeight(182);
    weightWatcher.addAsMember(harri);

    Person petri = new Person("Petri");
    petri.setWeight(112);
    petri.setHeight(173);
    weightWatcher.addAsMember(petri);

    System.out.println( weightWatcher );
}
----
In the output we can see that Juhana wasn't accepted as a member:
----
The members of weight watchers association 'kumpulan paino':
  Matti
  Harri
  Petri

=== Method returns an object
We've seen methods that return booleans, numbers, lists and strings. It's easy to guess that a
            method can return any type of an object. Let's make a method for the weight watchers association that
            returns the person with the highest weight index.
[source,java]
----
public class WeightWatchersAssociation {
    // ...

    public Person personWithHighestWeightIndex() {
        // if members list is empty, we'll return null-reference
        if ( this.members.isEmpty() ) {
            return null;
        }

        Person heaviestSoFar = this.members.get(0);

        for ( Person person : this.members) {
            if ( person.weightIndex() &gt; heaviestSoFar.weightIndex() ) {
                heaviestSoFar = person;
            }
        }

        return heaviestSoFar;
    }
}
----
The logic in this method works in the same way as when finding the largest number in a list. We use a
            dummy variable `heaviestSoFar` which is initially made to refer to the first person on the list.
            After that the list is read through and we see if there's anyone with a greater weight index in it, if
            so, we make `heaviestSoFar` refer to that one instead. At the end we return the value of the
            dummy variable, or in other words the <i>reference to a person object</i>.
Let's make an expansion to the previous main program. The main program receives the reference
            returned by the method to its variable `heaviest`.
[source,java]
----
public static void main(String[] args) {
    WeightWatchersAssociation weightWatcher = new WeightWatchersAssociation("Kumpluan paino", 25);

    // ..

    Person heaviest = weightWatcher.personWithHighestWeightIndex();
    System.out.print("member with the greatest weight index: " + heaviest.getName() );
    System.out.println(" weight index " + String.format( "%.2f", heaviest.weightIndex() ) );
}
----
Prints:
----
member with the greatest weight index: Petri
weight index 37,42
----

=== Method returns an object it creates
In the last example a method returned one Person object that the WeightWatcers object had in it.
            It's also possible that a method returns an entirely new object. In the following is a simple counter
            that has a method `clone` with which a clone - an entirely new counter object - can be made from
            the counter, which at creation has the same value as the counter that is being cloned:
[source,java]
----
public Counter {
    private int value;

    public Counter(){
        this(0);
    }

    public Counter(int initialValue){
        this.value = initialValue;
    }

    public void grow(){
        this.value++;
    }

    public String toString(){
        return "value: "+value;
    }

    public Counter clone(){
        // lets create a new counter object, that gets as its initial value
        // the value of the counter that is being cloned
        Counter clone = new Counter(this.value);

        // return the clone to the caller
        return clone;
    }
}
----
Here's a usage example:
[source,java]
----
Counter counter = new Counter();
counter.grow();
counter.grow();

System.out.println(counter);         // prints 2

Counter clone = counter.clone();

System.out.println(counter);         // prints 2
System.out.println(clone);           // prints 2

counter.grow();
counter.grow();
counter.grow();
counter.grow();

System.out.println(counter);         // prints 6
System.out.println(clone);           // prints 2

clone.grow();

System.out.println(counter);         // prints 6
System.out.println(clone);           // prints 3
----
The value of the object being cloned and the value of the clone - after the cloning has happened - are
            the same. However they are two different objects, so in the future as one of the counters grows the value
            of the other isn't affected in any way.

=== More assignments
All the new theory for this week has already been covered. However, since this week's topics are
            quite challenging, we will practise our routine with a couple of more exercises.
