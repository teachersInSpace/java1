== Instructions on code-writing and problem solving

Two of the leading software developers, _Martin Fowler_ and _Kent Beck_ have said in the book _Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code_ that:

* Fowler: "Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code
  that humans can understand."
* Beck: "I'm not a great programmer, I'm just good a programmer with great
  habits."

 [Update: previously both quotes were credited to Kent Beck. Our thanks go to Esko Luontola <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/mooc-issues/tickets/451/">for pointing out this mistake</a>]:</a>
We are now taking the first steps towards becoming good programmers.

=== Well indented and "breathing" code

Let us take a look at a code that first adds numbers to a list and then prints the items fo the list. Then all instances of a certain number are removed from the list and the list gets printed.

First, we write the code badly and without indentations:
// intended broken indentation
[source,java]
----
public static void main(String[] args) {
ArrayList<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<Integer>();
numbers.add(4);
numbers.add(3);
numbers.add(7);
numbers.add(3);
System.out.println("The numbers in the beginning:");
for (int number : numbers) {
System.out.println(number);
}
while (numbers.contains(Integer.valueOf(3))) {
numbers.remove(Integer.valueOf(3));
}
System.out.println("The numbers after removal:");
for (int number : numbers) {
System.out.println(number);
}
}
----

Even though the unindented code works, it is unpleasant to read. Let us indent the code (you can get
NetBeans to auto-indent your code by pressing Alt+Shift+F) and separate logical parts with line
breaks:

[source,java]
----
public static void main(String[] args) {
    ArrayList<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<Integer>();
    numbers.add(4);
    numbers.add(3);
    numbers.add(7);
    numbers.add(3);

    System.out.println("The numbers in the beginning:");

    // here we print numbers
    for (int number : numbers) {
        System.out.println(number);
    }

    // checks if the list contains the number 3
    while (numbers.contains(Integer.valueOf(3))) {
        numbers.remove(Integer.valueOf(3));  // if yes, it is removed
    }
    // we use a while structure to get all the threes removed!

    System.out.println("The numbers after removal:");

     // here we print numbers
    for (int number : numbers) {
        System.out.println(number);
    }
}
----

Now, the code starts to make sense. For example, the printing and the number removal are two logical
parts, therefore they are separated with line breaks. The code is <em>airy</em> and reading the code is
much more pleasant.

There are even comments in the code to help the reader understand what happens and where!

=== Getting rid of copy-paste with methods

What could be called the Original sin of a programmer is to create copy-paste code. This means using the same code in
multiple places by copy-pasting it around the source code. In our example, the printing of the list is done twice. The
code that handles the printing part should be separated as its own method. Then the printing method should be called from
the main program:

[source,java]
----
public static void main(String[] args) {
    ArrayList<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<Integer>();
    numbers.add(4);
    numbers.add(3);
    numbers.add(7);
    numbers.add(3);

    System.out.println("The numbers in the beginning:");

    // here we print numbers
    print(numbers);

    while (numbers.contains(Integer.valueOf(3))) {
        numbers.remove(Integer.valueOf(3));
    }

    System.out.println("The numbers after removal:");

    // here we print numbers
    print(numbers);
}

public static void print(ArrayList<Integer> numbers) {
    for (int number : numbers) {
        System.out.println( number );
    }
}
----

=== Slicing separate tasks into methods with descriptive names

Now, the code has become even more easy to read. A distinctively separate entity, the printing of the
list is now a method that is easy to understand. By defining a new method the readability of the main
program has improved. Pay attention to the descriptive name of the method: the name describes exactly what
the method does. Next, we can remove the advising comments <em>here we print numbers</em> , because the name of the
method speaks for itself.

There is still room for improvements in writing the program. The main program still looks a bit messy, since
there is an "unaesthetic" code line that directly manipulates the list, in between the neat
method calls. Let us turn that unaesthetic piece of code into a method:

[source,java]
----
public static void main(String[] args) {
    ArrayList<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<Integer>();
    numbers.add(4);
    numbers.add(3);
    numbers.add(7);
    numbers.add(3);

    System.out.println("The numbers in the beginning:");
    print(numbers);

    remove(numbers, 3);

    System.out.println("The numbers after removal:");
    print(numbers);
}

public static void print(ArrayList<Integer> numbers) {
    for (int number : numbers) {
        System.out.println( number );
    }
}

public static void remove(ArrayList<Integer> numbers, int removed) {
    while (numbers.contains(Integer.valueOf(removed))) {
        numbers.remove(Integer.valueOf(removed));
    }
}
----

In the example above, we created a new descriptively named method out of a separate logical entity,
i.e. removing all the instances of a certain number. The resulting main program is now very
understandable - almost like natural language. Both methods are very simple and easy to understand as
well.

Kent Beck might be proud of what we have accomplished! The code is easy to understand, easy to
modify and does not include any copy-paste.

== Object-oriented programming

Before we begin, here is a small introduction to object-oriented programming.

In procedural programming - which is the way of programming we have been studying so far - a
program is divided in to smaller parts, methods. A method works as a separate part of a program and it
can be called from anywhere in the program. When a method is called, execution of the program moves to
the beginning of the called method. After the execution of the method is done, the program will continue
from where the method was called.

In object oriented programming, just like in procedural programming, we attempt to divide a program
into smaller parts. In object-oriented programming the small parts are objects. Each separate object
has its own individual responsibility; an object contains a related group of information and
functionality. Object-oriented programs consist of multiple objects which together define how the
program works.

=== Object

We have already used many of the ready-made objects in Java. For example, `ArrayLists`
are objects. Each separate list consists of information related to it; that is, <i>the state of the
  object</i>. Functionality is also contained in the ArrayList objects: the methods by which the state of the
object can be altered. As an example, there are two ArrayList objects in the following piece of code,
`cities` and `countries` :

[source,java]
----
public static void main(String[] args) {
    ArrayList<String> cities = new ArrayList<String>();
    ArrayList<String> countries = new ArrayList<String>();

    countries.add("Finland");
    countries.add("Germany");
    countries.add("Netherlands");

    cities.add("Berliini");
    cities.add("Nijmegen");
    cities.add("Turku");
    cities.add("Helsinki");

    System.out.println("number of countries " + countries.size() );
    System.out.println("number of cities " + cities.size() );
}
----

Both the `countries` object and the `cities` object live a life of their own.
The state of each is not related to the state of the other. For example, the state of the
`countries` object consists of the Strings "Finland", "Germany" and
"Netherlands" that are in the list, probably also the information of how many countries are
in the list.

When doing a method call related to an object (for example,
`countries.add("Finland");`), the name of the object whose method is being called
goes to the left side of the period sign (dot), and to the right side goes the name of the method itself. When
asking how many Strings the `countries` list contains, we call countries.size(). We are
calling the method `size` of the object `countries`. What the method returns
depends on the state of the object in question, other objects do not affect the execution of the
method in any way.

We have used the command `new` many times already. For example, creation of a list
(`ArrayList`) and creation of a reader (`Scanner`) have been done using the
command `new`. The reason is that both of these are <em>classes</em> from which the object
is created. In Java, objects are always created with `new`, except in a few cases.

One of the cases where you do not always need to use `new` is in the construction of
Strings. The familiar way to create a String is actually an abbreviated way of using `new`.
A String can also be created with new just like any other object:

[source,java]
----
String text = "some text";       // abbreviated way of creating a String
String anotherText = new String("more text");
----

Cases in which ready-made parts of Java call `new` out of sight of the programmer also
exist.

=== Class

It is clear that all objects are not similar to one another. For example, `ArrayList`
objects differ drastically from `String` objects. All `ArrayList`s have the same
methods `add`, `contains`, `remove`, `size`, ... and
respectively all `String` objects have the same methods (`substring`,
`length`, `charAt`, ...). Arraylist and String objects do not have the same
methods because they are different types of objects.

The type of a certain group of objects is called a *class*. `ArrayList` is
a class, as are `String`, `Scanner`, and so forth. Objects, on the other hand, are
<em>instances</em> of classes.

Objects of the same class all have the same methods and a similar state. For example, the state of
an `ArrayList` object consists of elements inserted to the list while the state of a
`String` object consists of a string of characters.

=== A class and its objects

A *class defines* what kind of objects it has:

* what methods the objects have
* what the state of the objects are, or in other words, what kind of attributes the objects
    have

A class describes the "blueprint" of the objects that are made out of it (are instances of it).

Lets take an analogy from the world outside of computers: the blueprints of a house. The blueprints
define how the building is to be built and in that way dictate the shape and size of it. The blueprints
are the class, they define the general characteristics of the objects created out of that class:

.if a class is like a building plan
image::../images/house-plan.jpg[]
// <img src="https://raw.github.com/UniversityHelsinkiTKTL/MOOC-material/master/img/class.jpg">

Individual objects, the houses in our analogy, are made from that same blueprint. They are instances
of the same class. The state of individual objects, the attributes, can vary (color of walls,
building material of the roof, doors, windowsills, etc...). Here is one instance of a House
object:

.then a object is like the house
image::../images/house.jpg[width='400px']
// <img src="https://raw.github.com/UniversityHelsinkiTKTL/MOOC-material/master/img/object.jpg" height="250">

An object is always created from its class by calling the method - the <em>constructor</em> - that
creates the object with the command `new`. For example, a new instance is created from the
class Scanner by calling `new Scanner(..)`:

[source,java]
----
Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);
----

Constructors take parameters the way any other method does.

=== Defining your own class - object variables

A class is defined to serve some meaningful whole. Often a "meaningful whole" represents
something from the real world. If a computer program needs to handle personal data it could be sensible
to define a separate class `Person` which then holds methods and attributes related to an
individual.

Let us go ahead and assume that we have a project frame with an empty main program:

[source,java]
----
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
    }

}
----

We will create a new class in our project. In NetBeans, this can be done in <em>projects</em> on the
left, from the right click menu select _new_, _java class_. We will name the class in
the dialog that pops up.

Just as with variables and methods, the name of the class should always be as descriptive as
possible. Sometimes as a project progresses a class might transform into something different in order
meet the programmer's needs. In situations like this, it is possible to rename your class with
ease (<a href="http://mooc.fi/courses/general/programming/#netbeans-tips">see the NetBeans
  guide</a>).

Let us create a class named `Person`. The class will exist in its own
`Person.java` file. Since the main program is in its own file the program now consists of
two files in total. At first the class will be empty:

[source,java]
----
public class Person {

}
----

[source,java]
----
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;
}
----

The class has to define what methods and attributes the objects created from the class will have.
Let us decide that each person has a name and an age. It feels natural to represent the name as a
String and the age as an integer. Let us add this to our schematics:

[source,java]
----
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;
}
----
Above, we defined that all instances created from the `Person` class have a name and an
age. Defining attributes is done in a quite similar fashion as with normal variables. In this case
though, there is the keyword `private` in front. This keyword means that `name`
and `age` will not show outside of the object, but are instead hidden within it. Hiding
things within an object is called *encapsulation*.

Variables defined within a class are called _object variables_, _object fields_ or
<i>object attributes</i>. A beloved child has many names, but we will prefer *field* in this course, as this is
the official name in all Java documentation.

So, we have defined the schematics -- the class -- for the person object. All person objects have
the variables `name` and `age`. The 'state' of the objects is determined
by the values that have been set to its variables.

=== Defining your own class - constructor, or "formatting the state"

When an object is created its starting state is defined at the same time. Self-defined objects are
created for the most part in the same way as ready-made objects (`ArrayList` objects for example)
are created. Objects are created with the `new` command. When creating an object it would be
handy to be able to set the values of some of the variables of that object.

[source,java]
----
public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person bob = new Person("Bob");
        // ...
    }
----

This can be achieved by defining the method that creates the object, _the constructor_. The
constructor for the `Person` class that creates a new `Person` object has been
defined in the following example. In the constructor, the person that is being created gets 0 as her age and her
name is received from the parameter of the constructor.

[source,java]
----
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Person(String initialName) {
        this.age = 0;
        this.name = initialName;
    }
}
----

The constructor always has the same name as the class. In the code above, the class is
`Person` and the constructor is `public Person(String initialName)`. The value
the constructor receives as a parameter is in parentheses after the name of the constructor. You can
imagine the constructor as a method that Java runs when an object is created with the command `new
  Person("Bob");` Whenever an object is created from a class, the constructor of that
class is called.

A few notes: within the constructor there is a command `this.age = 0`. Through it, we set
a value for this particular object; we define the internal variable age of "this" object. Another
command we use is `this.name = initialName;`. Again, we give the internal variable called name the String
that is defined in the constructor. The variables `age` and `name` are automatically visible in the
constructor and elsewhere in the object. They are referred to with the `this`
prefix. Due to the `private` modifier, the variables cannot be seen from outside the
object.

One more thing: if the programmer does not create a constructor for her class, Java will
automatically create a default constructor for it. A default constructor is a constructor that does nothing. So,
if you for some reason do not need a constructor you do not need to write one.

=== Class definition - methods

We already know how to create and initialize objects. However, objects are useless if they cannot do
anything. Therefore, objects should have methods. Let us add to the `Person` class a method that prints
the object on the screen:

[source,java]
----
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Person(String nameAtStart) {
        this.age = 0;
        this.name = nameAtStart;
    }

    public void printPerson() {
        System.out.println(this.name + ", age " + this.age + " years");
    }
}
----

As seen above, the method is written within the class. The method name is prefixed with `public  void`
since it is assumed that users of the object should be capable of using the method and the
method should not return anything. With objects the keyword `static` is not used in method
definitions. Next week, we will clarify the reason behind that.

Inside the method `printPerson`, there is a single line of code that uses the object
variables `name` and `age`. The prefix `this` is used to emphasize
that we are referring to the name and age of <em>this</em> object. All the object variables are visible
from all the methods of the object.

Let us create three persons and ask them to print themselves:

[source,java]
----
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person pekka = new Person("Pekka");
        Person brian = new Person("Brian");
        Person martin = new Person("Martin");

        pekka.printPerson();
        brian.printPerson();
        martin.printPerson();
    }
}
----

The output is:
[source]
----
Pekka, age 0 years
Brian, age 0 years
Martin, age 0 years
----

include::{exercises}/ex73.adoc[]


=== More methods

Let us create a method that can be used to increase the age of a person by one:

[source,java]
----
public class Person {
    // ...

    public void becomeOlder() {
        this.age++;;    // same as this.age = this.age + 1;
    }
}
----

As expected, the method is written inside the class `Person`. The method increases the
value of object variable `age` by one.

Let us call the method and see what happens:

[source,java]
----
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person pekka = new Person("Pekka");
        Person andrew = new Person("Andrew");

        pekka.printPerson();
        andrew.printPerson();

        System.out.println("");

        pekka.becomeOlder();
        pekka.becomeOlder();

        pekka.printPerson();
        andrew.printPerson();
    }
}
----

Output:

[source]
----
Pekka, age 0 years
Andrew, age 0 years

Pekka, age 2 years
Andrew, age 0 years
----

When born, both objects have age 0 due to the line `this.age = 0;` in the constructor.
The method `becomeOlder` of object `pekka` is called twice. As the output shows, this
causes the age of pekka to increase by two. It should be noted that when the method
`becomeOlder` is called in the object `pekka`, the other object `andrew`
is not touched at all and he remains at age 0. The state of an object is independent of the other
objects!

Also, the object methods can return a value to the caller of the method. Let us define a method that
can be used to ask for the age of a person:

[source,java]
----
public class Person {
    // ...

    public int getAge() {
        return this.age;
    }
}
----

Now the `void` in the method definition is replaced with `int` since the value
the method returns has the type integer. The following example demonstrates, how the value returned by a
method can be used:

[source,java]
----
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person pekka = new Person("Pekka");
        Person andrew = new Person("Andrew");

        pekka.becomeOlder();
        pekka.becomeOlder();

        andrew.becomeOlder();

        System.out.println( "Age of Pekka: "+pekka.getAge() );
        System.out.println( "Age of Andrew: "+andrew.getAge() );

        int total = pekka.getAge() + andrew.getAge();

        System.out.println( "Pekka and Andrew total of "+total+ " years old" );
    }
}
----

Output:
[source]
----
Age of Pekka: 2
Age of Andrew: 1

Pekka and Andrew total of 3 years old
----

=== The Person class grows

Let us get back to work on the `Person` class. The current version of the class looks
like this:
[source,java]
----
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Person(String initialName) {
        this.age = 0;
        this.name = initialName;
    }

    public void printPerson() {
        System.out.println(this.name + ", age " + this.age + " years");
    }

    public void becomeOlder() {
        this.age = this.age + 1;
    }
}
----

Let us create a method for person that can figure out if a person is an adult. The method
returns a boolean -- either `true` or `false`:

[source,java]
----
public class Person {
    // ...

    public boolean isAdult(){
        if ( this.age < 18 ) {
            return false;
        }

        return true;
    }

   /*
      note that the method could also be written like this:

      public boolean isAdult(){
        return this.age >= 18;
      }
   */
}
----

Let us test it:
[source,java]
----
public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person bob = new Person("Bob");
        Person andy = new Person("Andy");

        int i = 0;
        while ( i < 30 ) {
            bob.becomeOlder();
            i++;
        }

        andy.becomeOlder();

        System.out.println("");

        if ( andy.isAdult() ) {
            System.out.print("adult: ");
            andy.printPerson();
        } else {
            System.out.print("minor: ");
            andy.printPerson();
        }

        if ( bob.isAdult() ) {
            System.out.print("adult: ");
            bob.printPerson();
        } else {
            System.out.print("minor: ");
            bob.printPerson();
        }
    }
----
Output:

[source]
----
minor: Andy, age 1 years
adult: bob, age 30 years
----

Let us tune up the solution a little further. Now, a person can only be printed in a manner where in addition
to the name, the age also gets printed. In some cases, we might only want to print the name of the object.
Let us tailor a method for this purpose:

[source,java]
----
public class Person {
    // ...

    public String getName() {
        return this.name;
    }
}
----

The method `getName` returns the object variable `name` to its caller. The
name of the method might seem a little odd (or not). In Java, it is considered the 'correct' way
to name an object-variable-returning method in this manner; as `getVariableName`. Methods
like these are often called 'getters'.

Let us edit the main program to use the new 'getter':

[source,java]
----
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Person bob = new Person("bob");
    Person andy = new Person("andy");

    int i = 0;
    while ( i < 30 ) {
        bob.becomeOlder();
        i++;
    }

    andy.becomeOlder();

    System.out.println("");

    if ( andy.isAdult() ) {
        System.out.println( andy.getName() + " is an adult" );
    } else {
        System.out.println( andy.getName() + " is a minor" );
    }

    if ( bob.isAdult() ) {
        System.out.println( bob.getName() + " is an adult" );
    } else {
        System.out.println( bob.getName() + " is a minor" );
    }
}
----

The print is starting to look pretty clean:

[source]
----
andy is a minor
bob is an adult
----

=== toString

We have been guilty of bad programming style; we have created a method that prints an object,
`printPerson`. The recommended way of doing this is by
defining a method that returns a "character string representation" of the object. In Java, a
method returning a String representation is called `toString`. Let us define this
method for person:
[source,java]
----
public class Person {
    // ...

    public String toString() {
        return this.name + ", age " + this.age + " years";
    }
}
----

The method `toString` works just like `printPerson`, but instead of printing
it the method returns the string representation. The call to the method can be used for printing it if necessary.

The method is used in a slightly surprising way:

[source,java]
----
public static void main(String[] args) {
      Person bob = new Person("Bob");
      Person andy = new Person("Andy");

      int i = 0;
      while ( i < 30 ) {
          bob.becomeOlder();
          i++;
      }

      andy.becomeOlder();

      System.out.println( andy ); // same as System.out.println( andy.toString() );
      System.out.println( bob ); // same as System.out.println( bob.toString() );
}

----

The principle is that the `System.out.println` method requests the string representation of
an object and then prints it. The returned string representation of the `toString` method
does not have to be written, as Java adds it automatically. When the programmer writes:

[source,java]
----
    System.out.println( andy );
----

Java completes the call during runtime to the format:
[source,java]
----
    System.out.println( andy.toString() );
----

What happens is that the object is asked for its string representation. The string representation the
object is returned and is printed normally with the `System.out.println` command.

=== More methods

Let us continue with the class `Person`. We would be interested in knowing the
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index[body mass index]
  of a person. To calculate the index,
we need to know the height and weight of the person. We add for both height and weight object
variables and methods that can be used to assign the variables a value. When this is in place, we
add a method that calculates the body mass index.

Here is the class `Person` after the changes (only the
parts affected by the change are shown):

[source,java]
----
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    private int weight;
    private int height;

    public Person(String initialName) {
        this.age = 0;
        this.name = initialName;
        this.weight = 0;
        this.height = 0;
    }

    public void setHeight(int newHeight) {
        this.height = newHeight;
    }

    public void setWeight(int newWeight) {
        this.weight = newWeight;
    }

    public double bodyMassIndex(){
        double heightDividedByHundred = this.height / 100.0;
        return this.weight / ( heightDividedByHundred * heightDividedByHundred );
    }

    // ...
}
----

We added object variables `height` and `weight`, and methods
`setHeight` and `setWeight` that can be used to give values to the variables. In
naming the methods, we follow the Java convention to call a method that just sets a new value to a
variable `setVariableName`. This type of methods are usually called <em>setter
  methods</em>.

The new methods in use:

[source,java]
----
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Person matti = new Person("Matti");
    Person john = new Person("John");

    matti.setHeight(180);
    matti.setWeight(86);

    john.setHeight(175);
    john.setWeight(64);

    System.out.println(matti.getName() + ", body mass index: " + matti.bodyMassIndex());
    System.out.println(john.getName() + ", body mass index: " + john.bodyMassIndex());
}
----

The output:

[source]
----
Matti, body mass index: on 26.54320987654321
John, body mass index: on 20.897959183673468
----

=== Object variable and parameter with identical name

Above, the method `setHeight` assigns the object variable `height` the value of
the parameter `newHeight`:

[source,java]
----
public void setHeight(int newHeight) {
    this.height = newHeight;
}
----

The parameter could also be named identically with the object variable:

[source,java]
----
public void setHeight(int height) {
    this.height = height;
}
----

Now, the name `height` means the parameter <em>height</em> and the identically named
object variable is referred to as `this.height`. The following would not work since the
object variable <em>height</em> is not at all referred to in the code:

[source,java]
----
public void setHeight(int height) {
    // DOES NOT WORK!
    height = height;
    // this just assigns the value of the parameter to the parameter itself
}
----

<h3>Contolling the number of decimals when printing a float</h3>

The number of decimals in the last output was far too high, two decimals would be enough. One
technique to control how a float number is printed is to use the command
`String.format`.

If `value` is a float number, the command `String.value( "%.2f", value )`
returns a string where the value is rounded to contain 2 decimals. The number between dot and f defines
the amount of decimals shown.

After changing the code, we have the following:

[source,java]
----
System.out.println(matti.getName() + ", body mass index: " + String.format( "%.2f", matti.bodyMassIndex()));
System.out.println(john.getName() + ", body mass index: " + String.format( "%.2f", john.bodyMassIndex()));
----

The output is:

[source]
----
Matti,  body mass index: 26,54
John,  body mass index: 20,90
----

The method `String.format` is not the most flexible way provided by Java for
formatting float values, but it is simple to use and suits our purposes here well.

[NOTE]
====
*Important notes regarding the use of objects. You should definately read these.*
Object-oriented programming is mostly about turning concepts into their own entities, or in other
words forming abstractions. One might think that it is pointless to create an object that only holds
one number in it, and that the same could be achieved with simple `int` variables. This is
not the case. If a clock consists of just 3 int variables that are then increased, the program loses
some human readability. It becomes more difficult to "see" what the program is about. Earlier
in the material we mentioned the advice of the renown programmer Kent Beck: <em>"Any fool can
  write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can
  understand"</em>, since the hand of a clock is its own clearly definable concept, it is a
good idea to create it an own class - `BoundedCounter` - for the sake of human
readability.

Turning a concept into a class of its own is a good idea for a lot of reasons. Firstly, some details
(i.e. when the counter makes a full round) can be hidden inside the class (<em>abstracted</em>). Instead
of writing an if-clause and an assignment operation, it is enough that the user of the counter calls
the descriptively named method `next()`. In addition to clocks, the created counter might be
good for being used as a building block for other projects too, so a class made from a clear concept
can be very versatile. Another huge advantage we gain by writing code this way, is that when the details
of the mechanics are hidden, they can be changed if need be.

We established that a clock contains three hands, it consists of three concepts. Actually the clock
itself is a concept too and next week we will make the class Clock. Then, we can create distinct Clock
objects. Clock will be an object which functionality is based on "simpler" objects,
the hands. This is the grand idea of object-oriented programming: a program is built out of small,
clearly defined co-operating objects.
====

Now, we will take some careful first steps in the object world. Towards the end of the course,
objects will start to come to you naturally and the idea of <em>programs being built out of small, well
  defined, co-operating pieces</em> - which at this point might feel incomprehensible - will become
something you will take for granted.

=== Calling other methods within an object

Objects can also call its own methods. Let us assume we would like to include body mass index in the
string representation of the person objects. Instead of calculating the body mass index in the toString
method, a better idea is to call the method `bodyMassIndex` from the `toString`
method:

[source,java]
----
public String toString() {
    return this.name + ", age " + this.age + " years, my body mass index is " + this.bodyMassIndex();
}
----

As can be seen, an object can call its own method by prefixing the method name with
`this` and dot. The this is not necessary, so also the following works:

[source,java]
----
public String toString() {
    return this.name + ", age " + this.age + " years, my body mass index is " + bodyMassIndex();
}

Now it is time to continue practising programming.

== Randomness
When programming, you may occasionally need to simulate random events. Situations such as the
unpredictability of weather, or surprising moves on the AI's part in a computer game can often be
simulated with random number generators, running on a computer. In Java, there is a ready-made class
`Random`, which you can use in the following way:

[source,java]
----
import java.util.Random;

public class Randomizing {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Random randomizer = new Random(); // creates a random number generator
        int i = 0;

        while (i < 10) {
            // Generates and prints out a new random number on each round of the loop
            System.out.println(randomizer.nextInt(10));
            i++;
        }
    }
}
----

In the code above, you first create an instance of the class `Random` with the keyword
`new` -- exactly as when creating objects implementing other classes. An object of type
Random has the method `nextInt` that can be given an integer value as parameter. The
method returns a random integer within the range <em>0..(the integer given as parameter- 1)</em>.

The printout of this program could be as follows:

We will need floating point numbers, for example when dealing with probability calculations. In
computing, probabilities are usually calculated with numbers within the range [0..1]. An object of the
class Random can return random floating point numbers with the method `nextDouble`.
Let us consider the following probabilities of weather conditions:

* Sleet with the probability 0.1 (10%)
* Snow with the probability 0.3 (30%)
* Sunny with the probability 0.6 (60%)

Using the estimates above, let us create a weather forecaster.

[source,java]
----
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Random;

public class WeatherForecaster {
    private Random random;

    public WeatherForecaster() {
        this.random = new Random();
    }

    public String forecastWeather() {
        double probability = this.random.nextDouble();

        if (probability <= 0.1) {
            return "Sleet";
        } else if (probability <= 0.4) { // 0.1 + 0.3
            return "Snow";
        } else { // the rest, 1.0 - 0.4 = 0.6
            return "Sunny";
        }
    }

    public int forecastTemperature() {
        return (int) ( 4 * this.random.nextGaussian() - 3 );
    }
}
----

The method `forecastTemperature` is interesting in many ways. Within this method, we are
calling the method `this.random.nextGaussian()`, just like any other time we have called a
method in the previous examples. Interestingly, this method of the class Random returns a value from the
_normal distribution_ (if you have no interest in the different varieties of random figures,
that's okay!).

[source,java]
----
public int forecastTemperature() {
    return (int) ( 4 * this.random.nextGaussian() - 3 );
}
----

In the expression above, interesting is the section `(int)`. This part of the
expression changes the bracketed floating point number into an integer value. A corresponding method
transforms integer values into floating point numbers: `(double) integer`. This is called an
_explicit type conversion_.

Let us create a class with a main method that uses the class `WeatherForecaster`.

[source,java]
----
public class Program {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        WeatherForecaster forecaster = new WeatherForecaster();

        // Use a list to help you organise things
        ArrayList<String> days = new ArrayList<String>();
        Collections.addAll(days, "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun");

        System.out.println("Weather forecast for the next week:");
        for(String day : days) {
            String weatherForecast = forecaster.forecastWeather();
            int temperatureForecast = forecaster.forecastTemperature();

            System.out.println(day + ": " + weatherForecast + " " + temperatureForecast + " degrees.");
        }
    }
}
----

The printout from this program could be as follows:

[source]
----
Weather forecast for the next week:
Mon: Snow 1 degrees.
Tue: Snow 1 degrees.
Wed: Sunny -2 degrees.
Thu: Sunny 0 degrees.
Fri: Snow -3 degrees.
Sat: Snow -3 degrees.
Sun: Sunny -5 degrees.
